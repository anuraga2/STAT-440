# STAT-440

This repository contains all the assignment files that I created as part of my STAT 440 coursework at UIUC. 
The code present in this repo serves as a good example of the following data manipulation task using R programming language:

* Reading different File Formats (csv, jsons, text files)
* Subsetting
* Filtering
* Mutation (Using Tidyverse and dplyr)
* Vectorization
* Implementing SQL in R
* String Manipulation and Regular Expressions
